# Clarifying Questions

1. **Scope of Mock:** Should the application handle multiple pages (routing) or be a Single Page Application (SPA) where all interactions happen on one page dynamically?
2. **Specific Event Types:** Are there specific industry verticals (e.g., E-commerce, SaaS, Healthcare) we should prioritize for the mock event examples?
3. **Visual Identity:** Do you have existing brand assets (logo, hex codes) for "trouv AI", or should I define a "tech-forward" color palette (e.g., dark mode with neon accents)?
4. **Interactivity Depth:** To what extent should the "configuration" controls work? Should the user be able to edit event names/triggers in the mock, or just view them?
5. **Output Format:** When "deploying" the tags, should the mock generate a downloadable JSON file (GTM export) to increase realism, or just show a success message?
